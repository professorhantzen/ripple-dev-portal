# Use Checks

Checks in the XRP Ledger authorize another account to claim funds later, similar to how personal paper checks work.

**Caution:** As of 2018-10-11, the [Checks amendment](known-amendments.html#checks) is not enabled on the XRP Ledger. You can use Checks on the [XRP Test Net](xrp-test-net-faucet.html) only.
